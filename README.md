# Digital-Die
This is my first project that is not proprietary. It was created to show off some of my skills with soldering, programming, and 3D printing. I have no intention to market or distribute copies.

**Please be careful if you choose to replicate this project as it contains pieces that can be harmful if not installed properly.**
